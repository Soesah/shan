Shan - Chinese Learning Flashcards

Ever since I started learning Chinese I knew I had to play with the language in order to learn it. Everyone has their own way of learning a language, and mine is to do as much as possible with it. I took classes, a couple of years ago, and built a little website to monitor my progress. I made flashcards for every word and character I learned. "闪" means 'flash', hence the name.

The website uses a single XML file to store characters, sentences, text, and a few other items. The website offers search, daily words, and a way to read sentences, entered in Chinese, in pinyin (the phonetic writing of 汉语 (Chinese)).
