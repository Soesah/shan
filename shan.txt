- chrome:some styling issues, perhaps remove the mozilla box sizing thing and restyle
- add shortcut keys for show hide functions?, catch backspace
- add loading dialog? make incoming dialogs display themselves...
V- create spaced views on character/pinying/english?
	- can you enter the text, then divide it up into word, by grouping characters in Xopus. 
	- Then you can find the pronunciation with those characters
- fix batches (perhaps as subelements, since it will break the XML)
- re-sort (once a day perhaps)
V- re-do how pronunciation is entered, it is really per character as well, one word is one card
V- new structure
    <word id="" batch>
        <characters xml:lang="" pages="" positions=""></characters>
        <!--or-->
        <character xml:lang="" page="" position=""></character>
        <pinyin xml:lang=""></pinyin>
        <meanings>
            <meaning xml:lang=""></meaning>
        </meanings>
    </word>
  this makes it easier to match words from sentences, and it is simpler. You will still be able to find characters
  

bugs:
V- when updating a character and then adding a new one, the updated character gets overwritten see ‰Ωç
- lower case all meanings, then lowercase searchvalue
